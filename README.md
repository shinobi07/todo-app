# To-do list website final Project

## Summary

The purpose of this project is to provide a To-do list website. It serve as a reminder for Internet users in order to note down a list of events, works that need to be done, and also some other lists.

The users can add items to the list to make it a personal reminder and they can test the website with random items created by the function.

Instead of ticking the input checkbox as a sign of completed todo item, users can click the name of the item to cross it out.

Our team does not initiate the app with 3 random items. We let the users decide what to do - to add or to randomly generate items for as much as they like.
After that, they can edit or remove the items from the list.

Shoutout to Brian Design. This is the original version of this todo app: https://github.com/briancodex/react-todo-app-v1
